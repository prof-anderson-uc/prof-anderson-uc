I'm a tenured Professor of Media Communications and Technology at the University of Cincinnati. 

When I'm not teaching, you’ll find me at home with his seven cats, hunting for a  elusive bottle of rare bourbon, exploring abandoned buildings, or taking photos. Check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/that_media_prof/) account to see what I've been up to lately.
